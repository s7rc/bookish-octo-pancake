## How to Set Up in Yuzu

Open `gamepad_and_mouse_server.exe` as administrator. It must be opened as administrator or the else the mouse will not be read. It also must be kept open at all times while being used with Yuzu. Open Yuzu and navitate to `Emulation > Configure > Controls` to set up your controls. I reccomend using the `Pro Controller` or `Handheld` as the emulated controller, as they only have one motion input. Near the bottom find `Motion 1`, click it, and shake the mouse until it says `cemuhookudp`. Your mouse has now been assigned as the motion device.

If this doesn't work, make sure the program is running as administator and navigate to the bottom of the Yuzu controller config window and find the motion checkbox. Ensure it is checked and press the `Configure` button under it. Under CemuhookUDP Config ensure Server is set as `127.0.0.1` and Port is set as `26760`. You can click `Test` to test if Yuzu is detecting your inputs.

(You also have to enable Gyro aiming in MPR's Settings)

**(Optional)** You can install [Metroid.ini](https://github.com/NarikoNep/pad-motion/releases/download/1.0.0/metroid.ini) from Releases into `%appdata%/yuzu/config/input` to get pre-created controls that closely resemble PrimeHack controls, no setup required. (This may need a tad bit of tweaking to be perfect for your use case)

Keep in mind Metroid.ini will automatically assign `cemuhookudp` as your Motion 1 input. If your mouse is not being detected, then try reassigning Motion 1.

To lock the mouse to the Yuzu Window you need to `Controls > Advanced > Enable mouse panning` and set it to 1%, to tweak controls afterward you need to press RightAlt and use the arrow keys to select the Options then you'll have your mouse back.

## Use in Ryujinx
It is possible to use Pad Motion in Ryujinx, however it is more difficult due to Ryujinx not allowing you to use motion controls when the keyboard is your input source. 

In order to map motion controls with keyboard, you will have to download a keyboard to gamepad remapper such as reWASD. (If you have a Wooting keyboard, you can use Wootility)
Once you have set up your keyboard to gamepad remapper, open Ryujinx and navigate to `Options > Settings > Input > Player 1 Configure` and change `Input
 Device` to your emulated controller. On the bottom right the motion menu will appear. Check `Enable Motion Controls` and `Use CemuHook compatable motion`. Then set Server Host to `127.0.0.1` and Server Port to `26760`. You can also adjust the gyro sensitivity and deadzone here. Once you have set up your controls, save and close.
 
Run `gamepad_and_mouse_server.exe` as admin and run Metroid Prime Remastered and change the camera setting to stick + gyro and it should be working.

Unfortunately Ryujinx lacks Mouse Panning, which is useful for locking the mouse to Ryujinx's window. However, there is this program (https://github.com/IamSanjid/RMB) that will solve that for you.
 
 # How to Edit and Compile

**(Optional)** Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Download and install [RustUp](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) keep in mind your CPU architecture (32bit or 64bit)

Then open CMD and run these command to make sure they are all installed and able to run
```
rustc --version
cargo --version
rustup --version
```

Open the Examples folder inside the `pad-motion-master` folder, then open `gamepad-and-mouse-server.rs` in your prefered Text Editor/IDE

Then Scroll all the way to the bottom and edit the code with the sensitivity that you want.

```
gyroscope_pitch: -delta_rotation_y * (YOUR SENSITIVITY HERE),
gyroscope_roll: -delta_rotation_x * (YOUR SENSITIVITY HERE),
```

After it is edited Save the file then open your Command prompt back up then cd into the `pad-motion-master` folder then run this command

```
cargo build --examples --release
```

It should take about less than a Minute to build

Your built EXE will be in `pad-motion-master/target/release/examples` folder

It should be the first exe `gamepad_and_mouse_server.exe`

## Controls using Metroid.ini
```
WASD = Movement
Space = Jump/BoostBall
CTRL = Morph
Flick your Mouse up = Spring Ball
Left Click = Fire
Right Click = Lock-On
F = Fire Missles
1-2-3-4 = Change Visor
E + 1-2-3-4 = Change Beam
~ = Map
Enter = Pause Menu
```

## FAQ

**1.) Pad Motion will not open and/or closes itself when opened.**

The port Pad Motion uses is probably already in use or Pad Motion is running in the background. You can test this by opening a Powershell window where gamepad-and-mouse-server.exe is stored and type `.\gamepad-and-mouse-server.exe`.

If you get the error something like **"thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Os { code: 10048, kind: AddrInUse, message: "Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted." }', examples\gamepad-and-mouse-server.rs:54:51"**, then you have another program or precess running that is using that port. Disable any process that is using localhost `127.0.0.1` port `26760`. 

If you get no message and lose the ability to type in Powershell, then Pad Motion is running secessfully.

**2.) Pad Motion is running, but Yuzu doesn't see it.**

Run gamepad-and-mouse-server.exe program as administrator and keep it running in the background. Do not close it. Open Yuzu and navigate to Emulation > Configure > Controller and select Pro Controller. Ensure the Motion checkbox is checked and click "Configure" under it. Make sure there is a server set up with `127.0.0.1` as the server and `26760` as the port. This is the default local server that cemuhook uses. Click "Test" and move your mouse around until the test is complete. If it's successful then Yuzu is detecting your mouse input. Now to ensure the mouse input is set as the motion control, go to "Motion 1" and click the input box below and shake the mouse. After shaking it, it should instantly say "cemuhookudp". 

**2.) Pad Motion works, but my inputs are all weird.**

You probably changed the Control Scheme to Pointer or Hybrid in MPR. Keep it at Dual Stick. Go down to Camera and change it to Gyro + Stick. Any other setting will not read the mouse correctly.
